## Usage
This project is intended for developers. You are free to extend the functionalities and integrate them with your FiveM server as needed.

## Note
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate that creating basic resource should not be a paid service. This was created to prove a point to someone who believes that charging for every minor script is justified. XD
